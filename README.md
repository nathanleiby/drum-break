# macroix

Macroix is an experimental drum training tool.

It is called Macroix based on "Macroquad" (rust game engine) + "LaCroix" (sparkling water).

The tool is in a pre-alpha state.

To run it locally, you can either:
- build it and run it with the rust toolchain
- download and run the most recent release from Github
