# TODO

_Moved todos to https://github.com/nathanleiby/drum-break/issues._

- improve usability of updating Latency offset.. clicking `]` over and over is slow.. and `shift + ]` jumps a bit too far per step (half it?).
- re-think audio scheduling. pretty sure i have a task for this but just a reminder ("just in time" is imperfect)
  - e.g. can stop sounds if they're removed, by calling handle.stop() ([docs](https://tesselode.github.io/kira/playing-sounds.html))
